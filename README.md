During project planning, it was decided to set an aim that all User journeys should aim to be completed in 3 clicks or less to provide an overall good user experience and provide a positive feeling when navigating and interacting with the application and website.  
As the application is aimed at a younger audience, click, tap targets have been increased to ensure no barriers are present or experienced during playthrough.

## Design  
The application was designed to be clean, clear and easily understood by its target audience, header and footer sections persist throughout the landing page and game application page to ensure navigation is kept consistent as to provide easy navigation and a pleasant user experience (UX).    
The application uses primary colours to reflect a bright and colourful, playful feeling.  
As a person with a visual impairment, the website has been designed with screen magnification and screen readers in mind.  

### Structure of pages  
The landing page website and application use a mobile first approach with the landing page having a maximum width of 1140px which centre aligns at higher resolutions and the application page following suit with a game area of the same width constraints to maintain the user’s focus, attention and sight lines.  

#### Header  
The landing page and application follow a universal approach which comprises of a left aligned logo for Mobile through to Desktop.  
To the right is the applications main navigation, which is responsive, full text links remain right aligned until tablet size and below where it will collapse to a right aligned Hamburger menu (toggle button).  
On devices tablet and below the user will be able to expand/collapse this menu using the menu toggle button.  

#### Main content area
The main content area is used to display content dynamically dependant on the user’s choice of action, when arriving on the landing page, this area is used to hold 3 large sections each with a simple to understand description and single call to action button.  
The areas are top section which briefly outlines the game with a call-to-action button inviting users to start the game followed by a middle section which contains a simple form inviting visitors to invite friends to the website and play QuizBox.  
Selecting to play now will load the game area which is detailed below.  

This approach was used to ensure that the user felt comfortable within the website and application, encompassing content within the header allowing the user to become familiar with the site navigation and always know how to navigate away or too their chosen area.  

#### Game content area
After a user has selected to play the game, the main area is filled with a game area, all game content required to take the quiz and proceed through all screens is presented to the user centrally within this area to ensure consistency, reassure a user of what to do and maintain a clean, clear user interface.  

#### Footer section
The footer section was designed to be useful and useable; the footer is divided into two half page sections at tablet and above screen sizes, dependant on if they are on the landing page or within the game application.  
The left side if within the the landing page it will shows QuizBox social media links or when within the application these have been removed.  
The reasoning behind this is to provide social links but not force social media on those playing who may not have access. This provides an effective way to offer online features but not force them.  
The right side displays a copyright notice when on the landing page and when within the game application.

Wireframe designs show Mobile, Tablet and Desktop views of the main concept and parts of the application.

### Colours palette. 
![colour palette](docs/colours/colour_scheme.png)   
- Sunglow: #FFC845 was used as this represents the sun glowing in the sky.  
- Prussian blue: #1B365D was used to represent a blue sky matching the sunglow yellow.  
- White: #FFFFFF was used as the main game background to represent clouds.  
The three remaining colours were used in specific areas, fern green was used as a primary colour to represent a correct answer whilst rusty red was used as an incorrect answer.  
Electric purple was used as a highlight colour and was used as it is a neutral colour liked by all genders.  
- Fern green: #58804D
- Rusty red: #DA344B
- Electric purple: #AA35FD
Other standard colours used were black.  
I used a tool called Contrast Grid [view live colour palette](https://contrast-grid.eightshapes.com/?version=1.1.0&background-colors=&foreground-colors=%231b365d%0D%0A%23DA344B%0D%0A%23ffc845%0D%0A%2358804D%0D%0A%23ffffff%0D%0A%23000000%0D%0A%23AA35FD&es-color-form__tile-size=compact&es-color-form__show-contrast=aaa&es-color-form__show-contrast=aa) to determine the foreground and background combinations to ensure a minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1 was maintained.  
![Accessible colour palette](docs/colours/accessible_colour_scheme.png) 

### Typography  
Fonts used across the site and application were provided by Google fonts and were used in certain areas as to maintain readability.  
The two font families used were, Electrolize and Poppins, the fonts have a default fall-back of Sans-Serif.  
Heading elements of the site used: Electrolize, which gives a robotic style to match imagery with Poppins being used across the remainder of site and application elements, to improve readability for users, the base font size was also set to 18px from the browser default 16px.  

### Icons and imagery  
The icon used on the main site was provided by Font Awesome free icon set with the image of a happy robot from freesvg.org.  
The icon was selected to represent something being sent to recognise the meaning of the section content.  
The icon can be scaled to high magnification levels and remain clear and sharp.  
The robot image was used as it appears cheerful and happy, as the application wishes users to feel while playing.  
![Accessible colour palette](docs/icons/icons_and_imagery.png)  
Social media icons for Facebook, twitter and Instagram were also used.
