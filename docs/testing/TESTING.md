### First time user  
- As a first-time user, I want to understand what the applications purpose is so that I can decide if it interests me.  
When a first time user arrives at the site, they will immediately be presented with a bold and easy to understand message that describes the objectives of the game.  
A new visitor would be immediately aware of the applications purpose.

- As a first-time user, I want to find out the rules of the game.  
Located within the navigation area, there is a rules link.  
This link will open a modal box which displays 3 simple rules about navigating the application and to not use browser controls. During testing this was decided was the best implementation as the modal could be activated no matter the place within game or on the website.
