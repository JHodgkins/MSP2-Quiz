# Research
I used online resources and personal experience as a parent of a child with learning disabilities and autistic traits when researching into the variety of quiz-based learning resources available to the target audience of this application.  
I found that there were available apps that shared many features including:  
- Large selection of questions across various categories
- Single and multiplayer options to play peer to peer
- Token or pass based way to increase or extend the level, hardness of questions.  

I found that there also seemed to be a persistent pattern when comparing paid apps to freeware apps which were:  
- Free apps may require certain data information such as contacts or other identifiers or require a token or pass to continue to play the game with no interruption, in some instances this is replaced with adverts which affect the flow of gameplay.  
- Paid apps seemed to require little to no data identifiers in most cases but appeared to offer so much variety of features to warrant the initial barrier to entry price of the application.  

I also found that some applications had specifically focused on certain categories such as Science, History and Maths rather that an umbrella approach of general knowledge, fact-based knowledge.  
This appears to be a benefit but when considering the price barriers and ease of use for a parent to simply use as a resource it may be more determined by the appeal of the applications interface to the child rather than the content contained within the app that determines its appeal or frequency of repeated playthroughs.  

The applications reviewed also seemed to cover a variety of ages 4 to 6, 6 to 8 and 8 to 11, which I question in regard to if this is a set age group set by an app store submission base or the developer’s choice of included questions.  

## User research
I reached out to the circle of parents who my child has contact with as their children also have other traits such as ADHD, Global development delay, learning difficulties alongside friends whose children are at their expected educational level and I asked them for their thoughts on the above research.  
Responses have been condensed for consistency.  

### Initial questions asked  
Question: **Do you allow your child to use your device to play games?**  
**User:** _‘Yes, but I have to watch my child sometimes as some have popups which interrupt the game.’_  
**User:** _‘Not often but occasionally, it is me that worries what is going to be shown on the screen, always seem to be blowing things up.’_  

Question: **Does your child play any quiz-based games?**  
**User:** _‘Sort of, there was one which was good at first and then became too hard, so they gave up.’_  
**User:** _‘Now and again but a lot seem to either be too easy or too hard for my child.’_  

Question: **Do you purchase games for them to play?**  
**User:** _‘No as they always seem to find another one as soon as they get bored, so we stick to free unless it is something everyone can play’_  
**User:** _‘Yes and no, I always find the free games have in-app purchases and I do not like my child having access to my bank details to buy something.’_  

Question: **Does you know what data is collected in some apps, websites?**  
**User:** _‘I stay away from any app that needs data just to play a game, why would they need it’_  
**User:** _‘I did not even realise they did, why would a game need my personal information.’_  

Focusing on the user interface and available features, people were asked:
